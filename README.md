## General info
	The actual dialect of Scheme used in this workshop/repo is called "Kawa".
	Please refer to the official docs of Kawa for more information:
		https://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/index.html
			
	
	Workshop container snippets of codes for different kinds of problems.	
		
	This workshop includes solutions to several, general algorithmic problems written fully in Kawa. The idea of writing it was for me(Nika) to get more familliar with functional programming paradigm.

## Most solutions are for problems from http://community.schemewiki.org/?ninety-nine-scheme-problems website
