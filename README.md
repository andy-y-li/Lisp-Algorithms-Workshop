## General info
	The actual dialect of Scheme used in this workshop/repo is called "Kawa".
	Please refer to the official docs of Kawa for more information:
		https://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/index.html

	This workshop includes solutions to several, general algorithmic problems written fully in Kawa. The idea of writing it was for me(Nika) to get more familliar with functional programming paradigm.
